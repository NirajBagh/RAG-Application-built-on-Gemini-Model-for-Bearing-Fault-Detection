# RAG-Application-for-Fault Detection
This project explores the application of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI). The system processes input from websites and generates a question-and-answer module focused on Brain-Computer Interface topics.To design this system, the OpenAI language model is utilized to enhance the retrieval and generation capabilities of the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI).
